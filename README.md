# The Distributional Reward Critic Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Perturbed Rewards

This project includes the source codes to reproduce the results in The Distributional Reward Critic Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Perturbed Rewards (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05710), which has been accepted by AAAI 2025.

Please first install Spinning Up and MuJoCo following the instructions in this link (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/installation.html).

Then paste the folders in **alg** to **spinup/algos/pytorch/**, and paste the files in **script** to **spinup/**.

**drc_sh.py** is to generate prompts for conducting experiments, stored in **drc.sh**. Feel free to run the prompts and modify **drc_sh.py**.
